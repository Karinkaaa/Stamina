together. We think it's important for you to realize how these ideas came \" +\n    \"together and to know that they have been refined through experiences with real students in real classrooms. \" +\n    \"The ideas in this book come, for the most part, out of our explorations together as we tried to integrate \" +\n    \"what we know about good literacy practices with what we know about vocabulary learning. A group of us, \" +\n    \"including the three authors, were part of a teacher research project with a focus on vocabulary that met \" +\n    \"for dinners, discussion, and brainstorming sessions for almost a decade. These meetings were part of what \" +\n    \"we call a think tank model of professional development and exploration (Henry et al., 1999). In this model, \" +\n    \"teachers and researchers come together, each bringing a high level of expertise in his or her own area. \" +\n    \"The combined expertise in our meeting room was amazing. Bonnie had taught for 30 years, served as the social \" +\n    \"studies helping teacher for her district, and, as a faculty associate (on loan from her district to supervise \" +\n    \"student teachers), taught the language arts methodology course for Simon Fraser University. At the time of \" +\n    \"this project, Bonnie was both a grade 6/7 teacher and the principal of an urban elementary school where \" +\n    \"students came from a variety of cultures and spoke several different languages. Jan had been a teacher \" +\n    \"for 23 years, the reading consultant for a large urban metropolitan district in Ontario, and a faculty \" +\n    \"associate who taught both the reading and the language arts methodology courses for Simon Fraser University. \" +\n    \"She was a grade 4/5 teacher at the time of the project and later became the primary literacy consultant \" +\n    \"for the Vancouver School Board. Both Bonnie and Jan had taught several different grades, from primary to \" +\n    \"intermediate, throughout their careers. Judy was an assistant and later associate professor in reading and \" +\n    \"literacy at Simon Fraser University after finishing her dissertation in educational psychology/curriculum and \" +\n    \"instruction/ reading/vocabulary at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Prior to that she had been \" +\n    \"a teacher and graduated with a Reading Specialist credential from the University of California at Davis. \" +\n    \"Other core members of the group mentioned throughout the book were a band of exemplary classroom teachers: \" +\n    \"Teresa Blackstone, Alan Jones, and Susie Cross. Cindy Butler was the main behind-the-scenes research assistant \" +\n    \"for the project, and she entered the teaching profession during this project. Our common connection came \" +\n    \"through Simon Fraser University, where several members of the group had served as faculty associates, took \" +\n    \"classes, or taught classes on literacy. From the outset, it was clear that the members of the vocabulary \" +\n    \"group shared a common vision and theoretical frame. In particular, we were informed by Lev Vygotsky's notion \" +\n    \"of sociocultural interactions and the power of discussion as a means to create new understandings and expand \" +\n    \"our horizons (Vygotsky, 1978). When Judy received a grant to explore alternatives to traditional vocabulary \" +\n    \"instruction, she invited members of the group to join her as teacher researchers who combined their expertise \" +\n    \"in teaching with her knowledge of vocabulary research.

The topic, vocabulary learning, was defined, but how we \" +\n    \"explored it together and what we were not.

We think it's important for you to realize how these ideas came \" +\n    \"together and to know that they have been refined through experiences with real students in real classrooms. \" +\n    \"The ideas in this book come, for the most part, out of our explorations together as we tried to integrate \" +\n    \"what we know about good literacy practices with what we know about vocabulary learning. A group of us, \" +\n    \"including the three authors, were part of a teacher research project with a focus on vocabulary that met \" +\n    \"for dinners, discussion, and brainstorming sessions for almost a decade. These meetings were part of what \" +\n    \"we call a think tank model of professional development and exploration (Henry et al., 1999). In this model, \" +\n    \"teachers and researchers come together, each bringing a high level of expertise in his or her own area. \" +\n    \"The combined expertise in our meeting room was amazing. Bonnie had taught for 30 years, served as the social \" +\n    \"studies helping teacher for her district, and, as a faculty associate (on loan from her district to supervise \" +\n    \"student teachers), taught the language arts methodology course for Simon Fraser University. At the time of \" +\n    \"this project, Bonnie was both a grade 6/7 teacher and the principal of an urban elementary school where \" +\n    \"students came from a variety of cultures and spoke several different languages. Jan had been a teacher \" +\n    \"for 23 years, the reading consultant for a large urban metropolitan district in Ontario, and a faculty \" +\n    \"associate who taught both the reading and the language arts methodology courses for Simon Fraser University. \" +\n    \"She was a grade 4/5 teacher at the time of the project and later became the primary literacy consultant \" +\n    \"for the Vancouver School Board. Both Bonnie and Jan had taught several different grades, from primary to \" +\n    \"intermediate, throughout their careers. Judy was an assistant and later associate professor in reading and \" +\n    \"literacy at Simon Fraser University after finishing her dissertation in educational psychology/curriculum and \" +\n    \"instruction/ reading/vocabulary at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Prior to that she had been \" +\n    \"a teacher and graduated with a Reading Specialist credential from the University of California at Davis. \" +\n    \"Other core members of the group mentioned throughout the book were a band of exemplary classroom teachers: \" +\n    \"Teresa Blackstone, Alan Jones, and Susie Cross. Cindy Butler was the main behind-the-scenes research assistant \" +\n    \"for the project, and she entered the teaching profession during this project. Our common connection came \" +\n    \"through Simon Fraser University, where several members of the group had served as faculty associates, took \" +\n    \"classes, or taught classes on literacy.

If you read this story you'll be able to find a common language with any American. All \" +\n    \"of them are very proud of their Constitution. The USA Constitution was written by fifty-five men who met at \" +\n    \"Philadelphia Convention in 1787. In four months they wrote the Constitution which has lasted over 200 years!\" +\n    \"All were white men. The average age was forty-two. Many of these men had been leaders during the American \" +\n    \"Revolution. About three-fourths of them had served in Congress. Most were leaders in their states. Some were \" +\n    \"rich, but most were not. None were poor. There were no native Americans among the delegates. There were no \" +\n    \"women. There were no black men or slaves. Poor farmers were not present either. George Washington, James \" +\n    \"Madison, and Benjamin Franklin were the three important delegates to the Convention. George Washington came \" +\n    \"from Virginia. He was probably the most respected man in the country. As the commander-in-chief of the \" +\n    \"American army during the Revolution, he was a great hero to most people. Then he had retired to his plantation \" +\n    \"and would have liked to remain there. However, his friends told him he should attend the convention. They said \" +\n    \"his support was necessary to get a new constitution accepted by the people. Since Washington thought a stronger \" +\n    \"national government was necessary, he came to Philadelphia. James Madison is often called the \\\"Father of the \" +\n    \"Constitution\\\". His ideas about government greatly influenced the other delegates. He had already developed a \" +\n    \"written plan for the new government which he brought to Philadelphia. It was known as the Virginia plan and it \" +\n    \"called for a strong national government. Madison took notes during the meetings. Much of what we know about the \" +\n    \"Philadelphia Convention is based on his notes. Benjamin Franklin attended the convention as a delegate from \" +\n    \"Pennsylvania. He was 81 years old and in poor health. Like Washington, he was highly respected by the \" +\n    \"Americans. He had been a printer, inventor and writer. He had also helped the country develop good relations \" +\n    \"with other nations. At the convention, he encouraged the delegates to cooperate with each other and work hard \" +\n    \"to settle their differences. His support of the Constitution was important to the other delegates. Once the \" +\n    \"Framers reached these agreements, it was time to get down to work and create a constitution. Delegates from \" +\n    \"states with large populations believed that a state with more people should have more votes in Congress. \" +\n    \"During the long debates, the Framers could not reach a decision on this issue. Neither side was willing to \" +\n    \"give in. The delegates were almost ready to quit and go home. A special committee of one delegate from each \" +\n    \"state was formed to try and find a solution. The members of the committee worked hard to find a compromise a \" +\n    \"majority of the delegates would accept. The result of the committee's work is known as the Great Compromise. \" +\n    \"The main parts of this compromise were: 1) Congress would have two parts, or houses. These houses would be the \" +\n    \"Senate and the House of Representatives. 2) Each state, large or small, would have 2 representatives in the \" +\n    \"Senate. 3) In the House, the number of representatives of each state would be based on the number of people \" +\n    \"living in that state. By May 25, 1787, the delegates from over half of the states had arrived in Philadelphia. \" +\n    \"From the start, the Framers agreed on 4 things: 1. George Washington would serve as president of the \" +\n    \"convention. 2. Each state, large or small, would have one vote at the convention. 3. They would not follow the \" +\n    \"instructions Congress had given them. They would not even try to improve the Articles of confederation. They \" +\n    \"thought the Articles had too many weaknesses. Instead, they decided to write an entirely new constitution. \" +\n    \"4. They wo.uld keep their discussions private. They also decided that what they said at the convention would \" +\n    \"remain a secret for 30 years. There were 2 reasons for this: 1) They believed they needed to speak freely to \" +\n    \"create the best possible constitution. If people could listen to them and tell others what they said, they \" +\n    \"would not feel as free to discuss their ideas. 2) They wanted the new constitution to be accepted by the \" +\n    \"people. They were afraid that the people might not accept it if they knew all the disagreements the Framers \" +\n    \"had. The agreement meant that each state would have equal power in the Senate. The states with more people \" +\n    \"would have more power in the House of Representatives. However, no law could be passed unless a majority of \" +\n    \"both the Senate and the House of Representatives voted for it. Because of this compromise large and small \" +\n    \"states could check each other's power and protect their own interests. When it comes to American newspapers, \" +\n    \"a lot of people outside the United States think of  that slender, serious paper, the International Herald \" +\n    \"Tribune, said to be on the daily reading list of many world leaders. The Herald Tribune, however, is not \" +\n    \"really an American paper. It is published in Paris (and printed simultaneously in Paris, London, Zurich, \" +\n    \"Hongkong, Singapore, The Hague, Marseille, and Miami) as an international digest of news, most of it taken \" +\n    \"from its much-larger parents. The New York Times and The Washington Post. Many people in America have never \" +\n    \"heard of it. And few Americans would read it when they can get the real thing, that is, the full-sized daily \" +\n    \"newspapers. In 1986, a total of 9,144 newspapers (daily, Sunday, weekly, etc.) appeared in 6,516 towns in the \" +\n    \"United States. Most of the daily newspapers are published rain or shine, on Christmas, Thanksgiving, or the \" +\n    \"Fourth of July (Independence Day). Including the 85 foreign-language newspapers published in 34 different \" +\n    \"languages, the daily newspapers in the United States sell over 63 million copies a day. The 762 Sunday papers \" +\n    \"are usually much larger than the regular editions. The record for a Sunday paper is held by The New York Times. \" +\n    \"One issue on a Sunday in 1965 contained 946 pages, weighed 36 pounds, and cost 50 cents. Reading the Sunday \" +\n    \"paper is an American tradition, for some people an alternative to going to church. Getting through all of the \" +\n    \"sections can take most of the day, leaving just enough time for the leisurely Sunday dinner. The Sunday \" +\n    \"newspapers have an average circulation of 57 million copies. There are also more than 7,000 newspapers which \" +\n    \"are published weekly, semi-weekly or monthly. Most daily newspapers are of the \\\"quality\\\" rather than the \" +\n    \"\\\"popular\\\" (that is, non-quality) variety. Among the twenty newspapers with the largest circulation only two \" +\n    \"or three regularly feature crime, sex, and scandal. The paper with the largest circulation, The Wall Street \" +\n    \"Journal, is a very serious newspaper indeed. It is often said that there is no \\\"national press\\\" in the \" +\n    \"United States as there is in Great Britain, for instance, where five popular followed by three quality \" +\n    \"newspapers dominate the circulation figures and are read nationwide. In one sense this is true. Most daily \" +\n    \"newspapers are distributed locally, or regionally, people buying one of the big city newspapers in addition to \" +\n    \"the smaller local ones. A few of the best-known newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal can be found \" +\n    \"throughout the country. Yet, one wouldn'stories expect The Milwaukee Journal to be read: in Boston, or The \" +\n    \"Boston Globe in Houston. There has been one attempt to publish a truly national newspaper, USA: Today. But it \" +\n    \"still has only a circulation of 1.2 million and, in its popular form, can only offer news of general interest. \" +\n    \"This is not enough in a country where state, city, and local news and political developments most deeply affect \" +\n    \"readers and are therefore especially interesting to them. In another sense, however, there is a national press, \" +\n    \"one that comes from influence and the sharing of news. Some of the largest newspapers are at the same time \" +\n    \"news-gathering businesses. They not only print newspapers, they also collect and sell news, news features, and \" +\n    \"photographs to hundreds of other papers in the U.S. and abroad. Three of the better-known of these are The New \" +\n    \"York Times', The Washington Post's, and the Los Angeles Times' news services. In one famous example, an expose \" +\n    \"of the CIA published in The New York Times also appeared in 400 other American papers and was picked up or \" +\n    \"used in some way by hundreds more overseas. \\\"Picked up\\\" is not quite right. Such stories are copyrighted and \" +\n    \"other newspapers must pay for their use. Often newspapers try to avoid paying for this news by using the \" +\n    \"original newspaper's story and quoting the story indirectly (\\\"The Washington Post reported today that...\\\"). \" +\n    \"Because so many other newspapers print (or \\\"borrow\\\") news stories from the major American newspapers and \" +\n    \"magazines, they have great national and international influence. This influence spreads far beyond their own \" +\n    \"readers.\";","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Toolbar, withStyles } from \"@material-ui/core\";\nimport EntryField from
